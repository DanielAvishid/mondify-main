## Overview

Workit Backend is the server component of the Workit system. Developed using Node.js and Express, this backend application employs industry-accepted conventions and best practices. Leveraging MongoDB as the database and integrating web sockets for real-time communication, Workit Backend seamlessly interacts with the frontend to provide a robust and efficient system.

### Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** The foundation of the backend, enabling server-side JavaScript development.
- **Express:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **Web Sockets:** Facilitating real-time communication for collaborative features.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database, ensuring data persistence and scalability.
- **Middlewares:** Utilized for handling various tasks and enhancing the server's functionality.
